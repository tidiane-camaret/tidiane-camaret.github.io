<p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
Hello! I'm Tidiane Camaret Ndir, a Machine Learning Researcher at the University Medical Center of Freiburg, Germany. 
My work is dedicated to building intelligent systems that are inherently generalizable, and designed for human interaction.
<br><br>
I believe the future of intelligent systems, especially in medicine, requires models that not only perform complex tasks 
accurately, but can also take direct human feedback as input, allowing them to generalize without requiring extensive fine-tuning.
<br><br>
This blog is where I explore the methodologies behind building these robust, adaptable, and interactive AI systems. Thanks for stopping by!
