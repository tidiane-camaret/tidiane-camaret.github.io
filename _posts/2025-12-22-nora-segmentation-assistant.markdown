[//]: # 3D segmentation models are getting performant, but they require fine-tuning on examples. New models are interactive : they can use user input as context for the segmentation task. However, they still require infrastructure (GPUs) to run. Also, while some high performing models are open source, they require time and programming knowledge to use, hindering their use in a clinical context. With the Medical Radiology department on the University Medical Center of Freiburg, we developped a tool for real-time interactive 3D segmentation, available to use for anyone from a web browser.
